    <h1>Project BrindiWanko</h1>

    <p>
        One night, a mysterious meteorite struck the heart of the continent. No one saw it coming — no warning, no sign. The impact
        was unlike anything the world had ever witnessed. In the days that followed, the skies turned a shade darker, and the balance
        of nature began to collapse.
    </p>

    <p>
        Animals, once peaceful and familiar, began to mutate into terrifying creatures. Forests became war zones. Cities were abandoned.
        Humanity retreated behind fortified walls, clinging to survival as the world outside turned into a twisted reflection of its former self.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Mission</h2>

    <p>
        You are one of the few brave enough to step beyond the walls. As a Seeker, your goal is to uncover the origin of the meteorite — now called
        the "Aetherfall" — and understand its mysterious power. Is it a weapon? A warning? Or something far more ancient and alive than we could imagine?
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Explore a dynamic and corrupted world filled with mutated wildlife and ancient ruins.</li>
        <li>Choose your character class: Knight, Mage, Ranger, or Alchemist — each with unique abilities and evolution paths.</li>
        <li>Investigate scattered fragments of the meteorite to gain powers or uncover dangerous truths.</li>
        <li>Craft gear using rare monster parts and forgotten technology.</li>
        <li>Unravel a branching storyline where your choices matter and the world reacts to your actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Mysterious Force</h2>
    <p>
        Whispers speak of an ancient intelligence hidden within the meteorite... guiding the mutations... watching from the shadows.
        Are you the hero destined to save the world — or just another pawn in a cosmic game?
    </p>

    <p><em>The truth lies beyond the Aetherfall. Dare to find it.</em></p>
