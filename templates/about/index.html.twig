    <h1>RPG Editor Project in PHP (with Symfony)</h1>

    <p>
        This project aims to recreate a complete RPG editor using PHP, but this time with the <strong>Symfony</strong> framework
        to benefit from a more structured and modern architecture. The goal is to provide a web-based platform that allows
        game creators to design and manage their own role-playing games with full control over elements such as monsters, towns,
        items, quests, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike previous attempts where I worked alone, I'm now collaborating with <strong>MasterG</strong>, which will bring new ideas,
        better productivity, and code quality. Together, we plan to design an open and modular RPG editor that is easy to install and use,
        even for people without advanced technical skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features Planned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Entity management (Monsters, NPCs, Items, Maps, Quests)</li>
        <li>Dynamic content creation and customization</li>
        <li>User-friendly administration interface using Symfony and Twig</li>
        <li>Database support (SQLite for quick setup, PostgreSQL/MySQL optionally)</li>
        <li>Clean and secure codebase</li>
        <li>Possibility to export or share the created games</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Language: PHP 8+</li>
        <li>Framework: Symfony (latest version)</li>
        <li>Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Twig templates</li>
        <li>Database: SQLite by default, support for PostgreSQL and MySQL</li>
        <li>Optional: JavaScript for dynamic admin tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project is both a tribute to the original Caranille engine and a complete reinvention using modern technologies.
        We are motivated, aligned, and committed to delivering something stable, beautiful, and truly useful for aspiring RPG creators.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stay tuned for progress updates, screenshots, and a public repository in the near future!
